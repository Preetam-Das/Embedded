A bunch of assembly language programs for interfacing the 8051 mcu with various
components and understanding its basic peripherals.

The `regdef.S` file is the common header file used by all the other programs.
It contains the various SFR memory locations and also the ISR addresses.

## Programs

- **blink** : Simple blinky
- **blink-button** : blink led when button is pressed (polling)
