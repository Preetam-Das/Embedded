## 8051/52

I decided to start with 8051/52 because i think it is what mostly taught as the
first micro controller here in India(at least that is what i think i might be
wrong i am not an EE/ECE student). Also 8051/52 seems to have a
very simple set of peripherals which are simple to get started with.

## Hardware

Specefically i am going with the Atmel(now Microchip) IC
AT89S52 variant of the 8051/52 family. I am using the [Atmel 8051 Quick Starter
Kit](https://www.silicontechnolabs.in/atmel-8051-quick-qtarter-learning-kits-silicon-technolabs)
by [Silicon Technolabs](https://www.silicontechnolabs.in/) which comes with a
Usb ISP programmer which makes it easy to program. The product can be found at
Amazon at a cheap price. Robu.in also has some [8051 development
board](https://robu.in/product-category/microcontroller-development-board/8051-development-board/)
for around the same price. I suggest buying from Robu because they are most
reliable online platform to buy electronics product here in India imho.

## Software

I daily drive Linux(*I use Arch btw*) not Windows so i try to
use open source softwares only wherever possible. For this case i am using [
Asem-51 ](http://plit.de/asem-51/) as the assembler, [ Sdcc
](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) as the C-compiler and [ Avrdude
](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude) as the programmer.
